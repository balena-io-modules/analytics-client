        to properly identify trends and behaviour of referrers since
        its more transparent than the previous behaviour.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Since we only want to append device id and session id when needed,
        that is, when navigating cross domain or cross component, now the
        getQueryString function checks if there is a passed destination
        hostname and if so it compares its main domain to the main domain of
        the actual URL the user is on. When a difference between the two exists,
        or there was no destination hostname passed it returns both
        d_id and s_id params. Otherwise if these 2 are the same, it returns
        an empty string.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        With this changes the consumeUrlParams dont override the client
        device_id with the passed one. Instead it returns the passed one
        if exists and the clean queryParams string.
        Then the amplitude Config is now allowed to recieve a device_id.
        So then the client creation happens, if a device_id is passed on Config,
        (which should be the one obtained from consumeUrlParams now),
        it initiates the client with that device_id, and if not, it initiates
        with no device_id, so it creates one.
        Since this changes modifies some of the base logic of the
        analytics-client, other components implementation should be
        revisited to comply with these changes.

    - subject: Fix broken cookies
- commits:
    - body: >-
        While working on integrating the latest client into our docs,

        I noticed that Amplitude client is not able to create its cookie.

        The issue is that in v5.11.0 they introduced the sameSiteCookie

        property with default value None. However, it works only wih the

        combination of setting Secure flag on a cookie in recent Chrome
        versions,

        which is not done.

        This change bumps the version, and fixes the behaviour setting

        SameSite attribute to Lax. It matches the latest Amplitude lib

        beehaviour (we don't update to the latest because of some breaking
        changes).

        We also pin the client version to avoid such issues in the future.

    - body: >-
        Because we migrate from mixpanel to amplitude and use

        the old distinct_id as a device ID, we can have situations when user ID

        and device ID are set to the same value in Amplitude client.

        However, the Amplitude service seems to ignore the user_id in such case.

        This leads to some problems with reporting (if the same browser is used
        for

        multiple users, we get events reported for a wrong user).

        This change ensures we don't set device ID to a user ID value when we
        have

        a choice (when multiple profiles are merged).
